#Introduction

This is a simple thought experiment to demonstrate how to go through the steps of the scientific method.
It's a silly example, that may have less relevance since soda bottles are more commonly sold in vending machines.

But many of you may remember or have seen people prior to opening a soda can go through some sort of ritual of tapping on top of the soda can's opening.  

#The dilemma

A person claims that the reason they tap on the soda can's lid or opening is because it prevents an explosion.

A basic idea about explanation includes the following ideas, 
which come from John Stuart Mill:

>In order to say that something causes something else you need the following:
>
> 1. Covariation, the cause and effect have to be related.
>
>2. Time precedence of the cause, the cause had to precede the effect in time; and
>
>3. No plausible alternative explanation of the effect. 

The last one is the most complicated. 
But it is the subject of what we do in an experiment.

Turn to page 1 of your worksheet and write out the definitions.

When you are finished just wait a bit for others to catch up.
If your neighbors are still working, you can help if they ask.

#Story Telling

On Page 2 of your worksheet, think about narratives. 

How to tell a story?  

Begin with the players and the problem.

In this case, what is apparently causing what?

Again, work on this individually but if others around you finish you can ask for help.  Feel free to offer help, as well.  

But don't just give it...giving unsolicited help, well, therein lie dragons. 


#A plausible story

I'm avoiding chemistry and physics,
and just focusing on whether tapping on a can prevents fizz.  

So, maybe tapping on the can allows bubble in the soda to move to the top of the can so when the can is opened, the gas in the bubbles can escape with little mess.

The story is saying implying the gas is distributed throughout a shooken can. 

It is also implying that tapping on a can can move these gases around.  

If so, then if we tap on the some cans that have been shaken, but do not tap on other shooken cans, then we should see one of these groups produce more fizz than the other.  


#Groups or conditions.

On Page 3 of the worksheet....

By now I hope you have come to some understanding that you should have 2 groups, a control group and an experimental group.

One way that this is helped is by putting things into tables:


```{r table1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "  

| Control| Exper | 
|:-----:|:-----:|
|  'n' cans| 'n' cans  |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

In fact, I can't help myself in not thinking in some sort of tables.
If you go down the path of getting into science and research, 
you may find that the creation of hypotheses lead you to thinking about how to organize data.

Continuing on page 3 to hypotheses

#Hypotheses

So, when doing research it is important to establish guidelines to help decide when you have actually found something.

In the case of science, we begin by writing hypotheses.
These are predictions about what will happen.
And we often begin with at lest 2:

1. The Null Hypothesis  

\[H_0: \hspace{5pt} Group_1 \hspace{5pt}= \hspace{5pt}Group_2 \]

2. The Experimental Hypothesis (also known as the Alternative Hypo. )

\[H_a: \hspace{5pt} Group_1 \hspace{5pt} != \hspace{5pt}Group_2 \]

note that != means not equal

Why do we make this sort of hypothesis? Why the Null? 

#The Null

The Null is a statement that there is no effect. 
In our case, the Null is saying that tapping has no effect on fizz, or more precisely:
\[H_0: Group_1 \hspace{5pt} = \hspace{5pt} Group_2 \]

or it can also be said like this:

\[H_0: Group_1 \hspace{5pt} - \hspace{5pt} Group_2 \hspace{5pt} = \hspace{5pt} 0\]

What is the X varialbe, and what is the Y variable?  

Are these the only variables that are important?
Can any other variables influence gas bubbles in the can?

Move on to page 4 of the worksheet.

#Variables of influence

Here is my list:

| variable                                                             |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
1. Temperature
2. Agitation (how much is the can shaken)
3. Brand  (root beer vs mountain dew)
4. Bottling  (I think this is not that important; like "made on" dates)
5. Time between agitation and open (this is important)
6. How does one tap on the can
7. Where does one tap on the can
8. For how long does one tap
9. How does one open the can
10. Full moon?
11. Altitude?

#Control of experiment

This is not the same as a control group.
A control group is the basis for comparison.
In more complicated phenomena, the choice of a control group may be very difficult. 

No, the way we 'control' for these other variables begins with whether we actually can control them.  This soda experiment is easy.  Psychological variables are more difficult. 

So, what should we do?  Well, make it so each of our variables has the same value for both the control and experimental groups. 

---

#Controlling these other variables

```{r make confound table, echo=F}
var = c('Temperature','Agitation','Brand','Bottling','Time b/w agitate & open','Time tap on the can','Where tap','For how long tap','How open the can','Full moon?', 'Altitude?')
method <- c('Keep in same fridge','Need a device or method','Use same','Pick same date','Need a device or method','Need a device or method','Need a device or method','Need a device or method','Need a device or method','Really?','Do experiment in same loc')

vocab.df<- data.frame(var,method)

knitr::kable(vocab.df,align = rep('l',5))


```

#Do the experiment

What are the independent and dependent variables in our little experiment?

Our story looks something like Tappying causes changes in fizz.  

So here is where some understanding of math and measurement comes in handy. 

Tapping can be measured in a few different ways.
You could say that tapping is a present or not present situation.
We might say it is dichotomous.  

The fizz, however, could be the same.
It could be present or not present. 
But it could also be meaured as an amount, or a volume.  

#Experiment with fizz as a dichotomous variable

Let's say we run the experiment and just note whether a soda can upon opening fizzes, or not.

```{r binomal soda data, echo=F}

tap <- c(0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0)
NoTap <- c(1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0)

binomial.tap.df<- data.frame(tap,NoTap)

binomial.tap.df %>% 
  gather(key='condition',value= "fizz") %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarise(count_w_fizz=sum(fizz),Count_of_N = n(),"%_fizz"=sum(fizz)/n()) %>% t()

n_flips <- 4
```

Does tapping work?  

Well, here is where stats can come to the rescue.
If our results were 100% 'no fizz' in the tapping group and 'all fizz' in the no tapping, then maybe we don't even need stats.  

But this is rare. 

To think about this, we might consider the problem is much like a coin toss.
And this is useful because we have a lot of knowledge about predicting coin flips.  

#Coin flip example

Understandably, you may feel uncomfortable thinking about stats and probability in an Intro psych class.  

I don't want to teach you formulas, but I do want you to think about hypotheses and predictions.  

If we flip a coin `r n_flips` times, or if we have `r n_flips` coins and flip them once, what is the chance that we'll have `r n_flips` heads or `r n_flips` tails?

Here is a quick simulation of `r n_flips` coin flips (assuming a fair coin of .5)
where the 'one' (1) represents heads and a zero (0) is tails.  

```{r simulate a single binomial outcome, echo=T}
x<- rbinom(n_flips,1,.5)
x
```

Does this seem reasonable?  

What if we did it again? 

#Another coin flip

```{r simulate a 2nd single binomial outcome, echo=T}
x1<- rbinom(n_flips,1,.5)
x1
```

Since these are randomly generated, it is possible we get the same number but it's also more likely that these 2 random flips of `r n_flips` coins are different.  

If we count up the number of heads and divide by the number of flips, we get `r sum(x)/n_flips`.  

How many of you were expecting exactly .5?
Since this is a random process, we won't always get .5.

#Graphing these counts

Here is a quick table and graph to show you the count of 'heads' in these two trials:

```{r graph two trials binomial outcome, echo=F,fig.dim=c(6,3),message=F,warning=F}
x.x1<- tibble(x,x1)
(x.x1)

x.x1 %>% gather(trial,value) %>% group_by(trial)  %>% summarise(total_Heads=sum(value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=trial,y=total_Heads))+ geom_point(color='blue')+ylim(0,4)

```

You may understand that if we did this many times, we'd get variations of these percentages but that they should be close to .5

Can we try that?


#Plotting of many simulated soda can experiments

Let's say I build a machine that can do the soda can experiment many times.  And lets say I use 10 cans for each condition, the NoTap and Tap.

(It's just like doing coin tosses.  )

```{r simulate many binomial outcomes, echo=F}

flip <- function(n=10){
  x<- rbinom(n,1,.5)
 # print(x)
  return(sum(x))
  }

flip.samp <- function(n=10){
  x<- sample(c(0,1),n,prob=c(.5,.5),replace = T)
 # print(x)
  return(sum(x))
  }

#flip(20)
sims <- 10000
flip.df <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=2,nrow=sims))
colnames(flip.df) <- c('NoTap','Tap')

for (i in 1:sims){
  flip.df[i,1]<-flip(10)
  flip.df[i,2]<-flip(10)
}

head(flip.df,3)
#nrow(flip.df)
```

So, this is just the top 3 simulations out of a `r sims` simulations.
Each row has two simulations of flipping shaking a can 10 times.  

The first row in the "NoTap"" group had `r flip.df[1,1]` cans that fizzed.

Of course it's random and gives us a way to think about what we should expect to get if our experiment were just random chance.  

It's like asking this question:  Our experiment found 8 vs 3 fizzes in the No Tap and Tap groups, respectively.  How often would we find that difference if this was all just random? 


#Counting the number of 8 vs 3

How many times did this random simulation create an event that matched our example of 8 versus 3 fizzing in the "No Tap" vs "Tap" groupings?

Here is the first 5 counts.  

```{r counting more extreme than 8 and 3, echo=F}
count <- data.frame(matrix(nrow=sims,ncol=1))
colnames(count) <- c("count")
for (i in 1:nrow(flip.df)){
  if(flip.df[i,1]>=8 & flip.df[i,2]<=3)
  {count[i,1] <- 1}
  else {count[i,1] <- 0}
}

cbind(flip.df[1:5,],head(count$count,5))
#head(flip.df[flip.df$NoTap>=8 & flip.df$Tap<=3,])
```

Let me count up the number of times this happened and just give a quick summary.

```{r, counting the number of 8v3, echo=F}

sum(count$count)
nrow(flip.df[flip.df$NoTap>=8,])/10000 #NoTap >= 8
d.8 <- sum(dbinom(10:8,10,prob=.5))
nrow(flip.df[flip.df$NoTap<=3,])/10000
d.3 <- sum(dbinom(3:0,10,prob=.5))

d.8*d.3
```

Not too often. Out of `r sims`, there were just `r sum(count$count)` times that our NoTap had 8 or more fizzes and our Tap condition 3 or less fizzes.

This means that if our null is true (that Tapping has no effect), then we would expect to find an out come (8 or more vs 3 or less) about `r sum(count$count)/sims` percent of time.

By the way, this is wha a "p-value" for those who have already taken stats. 

#A different way of counting...the difference between the groups

Now let's count the number of times a difference of 5 or bigger is found.  Here are all the differences in the simulation.

```{r counting differences, echo=F}
count <- data.frame(matrix(nrow=100,ncol=1))
colnames(count) <- c("count")
for (i in 1:nrow(flip.df)){
  count[i,1] <- flip.df[i,1] - flip.df[i,2]
}

head(count,10)
```

Let's plot all the differences on the next slide.

#Plotting these simulations

```{r plot binomial simulations, echo=F,fig.dim=c(5,3),message=F}

count %>% ggplot(aes(x=count))+geom_histogram()+labs(title = 'Count of differences between groups')

```

What does this graph mean?
Each bar is a count of how frequently a difference between these two groups occurred in each simulation.

Not surprisingly, most of the time we found a simulation that was around 0, or there was no differences between the groups.  This is because we created it that way. We assumed no difference, or a 50/50 chance for either a 0 or 1.

How often did we find a difference greater than 5?  

Well, `r length(count[count$count>=5,])`.  I just used the computer to do this for me. 

This was the number of times in our random simulations that we found a difference greater than 5.  That's not very often. 

#Back to the can

What can this tell us about our soda can experiment?

Well, we had the following

```{r binomal soda data part 2, echo=F}
binomial.tap.df %>% 
  gather(key='condition',value= "fizz") %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarise(count_of_fizz=sum(fizz)) %>% t()

```

But then we just made up some random simulations.
And out of those `r sims` simulations we found `r length(count[count$count>=5,])` events that matched our little soda can experiment: `r (count[count$count>=5,])`

This is saying that out of a `r sims ` simulations, it is uncommon to find a difference of 5 or larger randomly.  In fact, it's simply 

\[\frac{diff's >= 5}{sims}\] 

or `r length(count[count$count>=5,])/sims `.

In other words, the chances of finding this size difference is `r length(count[count$count>=5,])/sims `.



#Experiment with fizz as an amount
