##Introduction

This is a simple thought experiment to demonstrate how to go through the steps of the scientific method.
It's a silly example, that may have less relevance since soda bottles are more commonly sold in vending machines.

But many of you may remember or have seen people prior to opening a soda can go through some sort of ritual of tapping on top of the soda can's openning.  

##The dilemma

A person claims that the reason they tap on the soda can's lid or openning is because it prevents an explosion.

A basic idea about explanation includes the following ideas, 
which come from John Stuart Mill:

>In order to say that something causes something else you need the following:
>
> 1. Covariation, the cause and effect have to be related.
>
>2. Time precedence of the cause, the cause had to precede the effect in time; and
>
>3. No plausible alternative explanation of the effect. 

The last one is the most complicated. 
But it is the subject of what we do in an experiment.

##Story Telling

How to tell a story?  Begin with the players and the problem.

In this case, what is apparently causing what?  

##Groups

By now I hope you have come to some understanding that you should have 2 groups, a control group and an experimental

One way that this is helped is by putting things into tables:


```{r table1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "  

| Control| Exper | 
|:-----:|:-----:|
|  10 cans| 10 cans  |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

##Hypotheses

So, when doing research it is important to establish guidelines to help decide when you have actually found something.

In the case of science, we begin by writing hypotheses.
These are predictions about what will happen.
And we often begin with at lest 2:

1. The Null Hypothesis  

\[H_0: X= Y \]

2. The Experimental Hypothesis (also known as the Alternative Hypo. )

\[H_a: X != Y \]

Why do we make this sort of hypothesis? Why the Null? 

##Varialbes of influence

Here is my list:

1. Temperature
2. Agitation (how much is it shaken)
3. Brand  (root beer vs mountain dew)
4. Bottling  (I think this isn't as important, like "made on" dates)
5. Time between agitation and open (this is important)
6. How does one tap on the can
7. Where does one tap on the can
8. For how long does one tap
9. How does one open the can
10. Full moon?
11. Altitude?

##Control of experiment

This is not the same as a contrl group.
A control group is the basis for comparison.
In more complicated phenomena, the choice of a control group may be very difficult. 

No, the way we 'control' for these other variables begins with whether we actually can control them.  This soda experiment is easy.  Psychological variables are more difficult. 

So, what should we do?  Well, make it so each of our variables has the same value for both the control and experimental groups.

##Controlling these other variables

1. Temperature                 Keep in same fridge
2. Agitation                   Need a device or method
3. Brand                       Use same
4. Bottling                    Pick same date  
5. Time b/w agitate/open       Need a device or method
6. tap on the can              Need a device or method  
7. Where tap                   Need a device or method
8. For how long tap            Need a device or method
9. How open the can            Need a device or method
10. Full moon?                 Really?
11. Altitude?                  Do experiment in same loc
